# Multi-Stance Detection using Adversarial Attention Network
This final year project aims to detect the stance of a text toward a specific targetâ€”classifying it as supportive, opposing, or neutral. Initially, LSTM and CNN models were explored, but the current approach leverages an advanced architecture combining *MTAAN (Multi-Target Adversarial Attention Network)*
a *BERT Encoder* to improve performance and generalization.
The system features a user-friendly *Streamlit frontend* and a *Flask backend*, offering real-time predictions and model interactions. Model training and evaluation were performed using Google Colab, and results show improved accuracy and robustness compared to previous models.
